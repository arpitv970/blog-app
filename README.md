# Full Stack Blog App - Frontend
This is the frontend part of the project `Full Stack Blog App`, where I would be building simple boring stuff in much more of a nerdy way. This project has many flaws but consider it as a part of a learning curve that I would be documenting along with the project journey.

## Tech Stack
This section is quite variable, and is keep changing as the complexity of the project grows, for the inital releases we would dual-repo architecture. Thus in this repo I would me mentioning stacks invovled for Frontend only.
- Nextjs 14 + App Router (stable version for now)
- ShadCn UI (works fine with Nextjs 14)
- Apollo Client (for managing `GraphQL` apis from frontend)
- TypeScript (must have!)
- TailwindCSS (no intro needed)

## Getting Started
- Fork this repository
- Clone the project
- Run `npm i`, to get all `node_modules` dependencies
